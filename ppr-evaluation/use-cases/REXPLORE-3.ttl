    rdfs:label "This ontology is automatically populated and periodically updated by the Klink algorithm [...], which takes as input  a corpus of publications, annotated with keywords (these can be user- defined or automatically extracted from the text  of a publication) and performs three key operations, using a combination of statistical methods and background knowledge: • It identifies research areas from the given set of keywords, tidying them up by fixing errors and by removing keywords  that do not denote research areas – e.g., “Case Study” or “NeOn Project”. • It automatically computes three types of semantic relationships between research areas [...] • It returns a knowledge base of semantic relationships expressed in OWL. In particular, Klink computes the following three relationships between topics: • skos:broaderGeneric. [...] • contributesTo. This is defined as a sub-property of skos:related [...] • relatedEquivalent. This is also defined as a sub-property of skos:related [...] Our ontology builds on the BIBO ontology, which in turn builds on SKOS, FOAF and other standards.  [...] Currently it comprises 1500 topics linked by almost 3000 semantic relationships. " .
